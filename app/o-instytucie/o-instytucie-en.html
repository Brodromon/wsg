                                units operating in Poland. In this connection, the so-called basic courses

                                CCPL will conduct Polish language certification - including certification for 
                                teachers - as well as provide accreditation for language schools operating in

                                Nicolaus Copernicus as the Patron of the Institute of the European University of Economics
                            </h4>
                            <p>
                                The University authorities, in consultation with foreign partners, have decided to 
                                give the European Institute the name of Nicolaus Copernicus. The patron symbolizes 
                                the objectives of the Institute of the European WSG, and at the same time being 
                                universally recognized throughout the world, including in Eastern Europe and the 
                                Middle East, does not raise any controversy about a cultural, philosophical or 
                                religious nature, despite the fact that he was a priest and fulfilled important church's functions.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The significance of the Copernicus discovery, often referred to as the "Copernican revolution", 
                                puts it in the row of the most prominent figures of science in the history of the world, among 
                                such giants of mind as: Kepler, Newton, Darwin, Einstein, Hubble, Fleming or Heisenberg. 
                                The choice of Copernicus as a patron also emphasizes the universal values and common heritage 
                                connecting Europe and its immediate surroundings, which grew on the ruins of the western and 
                                eastern empires, the legacy of Rome and Byzantium. The choice of the patron was also dictated 
                                by the recognition of the universal values of humanism and European philosophical thought, 
                                which in the inquiries over the nature and cause of the universe, perceived the most perfect 
                                manifestation of intelligent life.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Copernicus was one of the best and most distinguished representatives of this thought. One can 
                                successfully say that he was a man of the Renaissance, universally educated: astronomer, 
                                mathematician, lawyer and physician. This outstanding Pole, apart from the heliocentric 
                                conception of building the world, also contributed to economic sciences with his treaty 
                                on coin minting and taxes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The choice of the patron was important for his biography, including the history of his family, 
                                which begins in Silesia, which was then a borderland, then under the influence of many cultures. 
                                Born in Toruń, which remained a model of peaceful and consistent coexistence of people of 
                                different cultures and religions. He studied in various cities and countries, in Krakow, 
                                Padua and Bologna. He conducted his scientific investigations in Warmia, in which these 
                                influences were clearly marked. He was, therefore, a thoroughly universalist character - 
                                how characteristic of the role of the Republic at the turn of the 15th and 16th centuries 
                                as an intermediary between the West and the East of Europe. It was able to absorb the 
                                technical solutions of the Ottoman Empire which was pressing south of Europe, which also 
                                mediated in the cultural influences of peoples and nations scattered on the southern and 
                                eastern shores of the Mediterranean.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Also the times of the breakthrough in which he lived, favored taking up new challenges, 
                                making bold hypotheses, providing new justifications, in short, favored bold and unscientific 
                                thinking. Copernicus, drawing from the spiritual resources of a bygone era, was able to 
                                direct his intellectual potential towards new times, the most important manifestation of 
                                which was to become science. Therefore, this modest and unpretentious father of modern 
                                science - our compatriot, and at the same time a compatriot from Kujawy and Pomerania - 
                                can not become the Patron of the Institution, which formulates such a broad and deep mission.
